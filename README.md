#UFO sighting

#Level 1
* Firstly, utilized the premade HTML index file. 
* We use UFO dataset in this assignment initially to append a table to the web page and then add rows for UFO sightings
* Goal: filter the table data based on the date that is given by the user. 
* * For example, when the user inputs 1/2/2010 - only specific rows from the date 1/2/2010 shows up.
