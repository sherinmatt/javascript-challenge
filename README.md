## UFO sighting

### General Information
* In this work, we focus on the UFO sigtings dataset. 
* Premade HTML index file was already made avaiable. 

###UFO-Level 1 Features
* Firstly, we use the UFO dataset to append a table to the web page and then add rows for UFO sightings.
* Next Goal: By using Javascript, filtered the table data based on the date that is given by the user. 
* * For example, when the user inputs 1/2/2010 - only specific rows from the date 1/2/2010 appears on the web page.
